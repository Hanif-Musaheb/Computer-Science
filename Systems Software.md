## OCR â€“ Optical Character Recognition
- OCR converts images of text into editable text with separate characters.
- OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) reads multi-choice answer papers and is able to recognise, based off which box is ticked, whether the candidate is right or wrong.
- Barcodes are a sequence of black and white lines, which are used to store a unique key for that product.
- The barcode allows devices reading the barcode to look up data about the product on a database.
- Different values are represented by different thicknesses of lines.
- At the start and end of the barcode there are terminators that allow the reader to know when the barcode begins and ends.
