OCR â€“ Optical Character Recognition

OCR converts images of text into editable text with separate characters.


OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) reads multi-choice answer papers and is able to recognise, based off which box is ticked, whether the candidate is right or wrong.


Barcodes are a sequence of black and white lines, which are used to store a unique key for that product.


The barcode allows devices reading the barcode to look up data about the product on a database.


Different values are represented by different thicknesses of lines. At the start and end of the barcode there are terminators that allow the reader to know when the barcode begins and ends.
