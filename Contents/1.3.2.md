# Databases

## Database types
- A flat file database is a database with only one table.
- A table orders information in columns and rows, or records and fields in database terms.
- An entity is an object that exists in real life. For example, if you were making an entity for the house someone lives in.
- A field in a database is the same as a column.
- A record in a database is the same as a row.
- Validation checks that the user has inputted the required information or data type for the field.
- A query is used to retrieve information from a database. Simple queries return a small number of fields, whereas complex fields are able to show the user large parts of databases.
- A report presents the information in a database in a user-friendly fashion.

## Types of Validation

- **Format Check** - Makes sure the data inserted into the field matches the right format
  
  Example: If you were to input your age, a format check would make sure it was an integer, not a string

- **Length Check** - Checks the data to see if it fits the field input length
  
  Example: A telephone number that can only be 11 digits

- **Presence Check** - Checks that a field has not been left blank in a database
  
  Example: If there is no data inputted into a field in a database, it’s common that an alert will pop up telling you not to leave it blank

- **Range Check** - Checks that the number inputted is within the specified range
  
  Example: Age must be between 0 and 120

- **Spell Check** - Compares your inputted words to those of the dictionary and if they don’t match, it pops up with an error
  
  Example: In applications such as Microsoft Word or other word processors.
