## Von Neumann, Harvard and Contemporary Architectures
In **Von Neumann Architecture**, data and instructions are stored together in the same memory and share the same data bus. However, some computers, mainly specialist and embedded systems, use **Harvard Architecture**.

In Harvard Architecture, data and instructions are stored separately, and use different data buses.
